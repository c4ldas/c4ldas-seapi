<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>This project aims to have an easy way to share and install Streamelements overlays in your Twitch channel using a simple code. Also, here I am going to share some widgets that I created so the community can use it on their channels.</p>

<p>Most of the overlays are written for Twitch, but nothing is stopping you from using them on other platforms (unless they are specifically designed for it).</p>

<p>A small portion of the page is dedicated to custom endpoints. At the moment, there are only two endpoints. One is the top leaderboard and the other is the top watchtime. Both can be used on your stream chat. Suggestions for new endpoints are highly accepted.</p>

<p>If you find any issues on the page or something is not working as expected, please let me know. Also, if you have any idea or suggestions feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>You can find instructions on how to use it below:</p>

<h2>Webpage</h2>

<p>The project main URL is: </p>
<p><a href="https://seapi.c4ldas.com.br" target="_blank">https://seapi.c4ldas.com.br</a></p>

<h3>If you want to share an overlay you created:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to https://seapi.c4ldas.com.br and click on <code>Share overlay / widget</code>;</li> <br />
<li>Click on <code>Login with Streamelements</code> and authorize the application to have access to your overlays;</li><br />
<li>After authorization, the page will show all of your overlays, simply click on the one you want to share and a popup will appear with a code;</li><br />
<li>Copy that code and send to your friend.</li><br />
</ul>

<h3>If you want to install an overlay:</h3>
<ul>

  <li>If you want to remove it, just click on the üóëÔ∏è icon and confirm;</li><br />
  <li>Attention: That will not remove the overlay from the accounts that have it installed! It will just remove the option to be installed again.</li><br />
